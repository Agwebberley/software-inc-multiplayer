            This gets called if IsComplete returned false on the first call.

            This is needed because the exception isn't always accessible when running

            what happened.

             Send the message unreliably. Can be lost.  Messages *can* be larger than a

             of the message is lost, the entire message will be dropped.
            
             The sending API does have some knowledge of the underlying connection, so
             if there is no NAT-traversal accomplished or there is a recognized adjustment
             happening on the connection, the packet will be batched until the connection

            sent soon after you send this, which can be grouped together.  Any time there
            is enough buffered data to fill a packet, the packets will be pushed out immediately,
            but partially-full packets not be sent until the Nagle timer expires.

             Object that describes a "location" on the Internet with sufficient
             detail that we can reasonably estimate an upper bound on the ping between
             the two hosts, even if a direct route between the hosts is not possible,
             and the connection must be routed through the Steam Datagram Relay network.
             This does not contain any information that identifies the host.  Indeed,
             if two hosts are in the same building or otherwise have nearly identical
             networking characteristics, then it's valid to use the same location
             object for both of them.
            
             NOTE: This object should only be used in the same process!  Do not serialize it,
             send it over the wire, or persist it in a file or database!  If you need
             to do that, convert it to a string representation using the methods in
             ISteamNetworkingUtils().

        <member name="M:Facepunch.Steamworks.Data.NetPingLocation.EstimatePingTo(Facepunch.Steamworks.Data.NetPingLocation)">
             Estimate the round-trip latency between two arbitrary locations, in
             milliseconds.  This is a conservative estimate, based on routing through
             the relay network.  For most basic relayed connections, this ping time
             will be pretty accurate, since it will be based on the route likely to
             be actually used.
            
             If a direct IP route is used (perhaps via NAT traversal), then the route
             will be different, and the ping time might be better.  Or it might actually
             be a bit worse!  Standard IP routing is frequently suboptimal!
            
             But even in this case, the estimate obtained using this method is a
             reasonable upper bound on the ping time.  (Also it has the advantage
             of returning immediately and not sending any packets.)
            
             In a few cases we might not able to estimate the route.  In this case
             a negative value is returned.  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Failed means
             the reason was because of some networking difficulty.  (Failure to
             ping, etc)  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Unknown is returned if we cannot
             currently answer the question for some other reason.
            
             Do you need to be able to do this from a backend/matchmaking server?

            have been traded or consumed since the result set was generated.You could compare

            an updated result set.
            You should call CheckResultSteamID on the result handle when it completes to verify

            A function to receive debug network information on. This will do nothing
            unless you set DebugLevel to something other than None.
            
            You should set this to an appropriate level instead of setting it to the highest
            and then filtering it by hand because a lot of energy is used by creating the strings
            and your frame rate will tank and you won't know why.

             <summary>
             If you know that you are going to be using the relay network (for example,
             because you anticipate making P2P connections), call this to initialize the
             relay network.  If you do not call this, the initialization will
             be delayed until the first time you use a feature that requires access
             to the relay network, which will delay that first access.
            
             You can also call this to force a retry if the previous attempt has failed.
             Performing any action that requires access to the relay network will also
             trigger a retry, and so calling this function is never strictly necessary,
             but it can be useful to call it a program launch time, if access to the
             relay network is anticipated.
            
             Use GetRelayNetworkStatus or listen for SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t
             callbacks to know when initialization has completed.
             Typically initialization completes in a few seconds.
            
             Note: dedicated servers hosted in known data centers do *not* need
             to call this, since they do not make routing decisions.  However, if
             the dedicated server will be using P2P functionality, it will act as
             a "client" and this should be called.

             you call this very soon after startup the data may not be available yet.

            Causes the Steam overlay to take a screenshot.

            Toggles whether the overlay handles screenshots when the user presses the screenshot hotkey, or if the game handles them.
            Hooking is disabled by default, and only ever enabled if you do so with this function.
            If the hooking is enabled, then the ScreenshotRequested_t callback will be sent if the user presses the hotkey or 
            when TriggerScreenshot is called, and then the game is expected to call WriteScreenshot or AddScreenshotToLibrary in response.

             need to Present() to the screen any time an even needing a notification happens or when the overlay is
             brought up over the game by a user.  You can use this API to ask the overlay if it currently need a present

            <summary>
            Serialized result sets contain a short signature which can't be forged or replayed across different game sessions.
            A result set can be serialized on the local client, transmitted to other players via your game networking, and 
            deserialized by the remote players.This is a secure way of preventing hackers from lying about posessing 
            rare/high-value items. Serializes a result set with signature bytes to an output buffer.The size of a serialized 
            result depends on the number items which are being serialized.When securely transmitting items to other players, 
            it is recommended to use GetItemsByID first to create a minimal result set.
            Results have a built-in timestamp which will be considered "expired" after an hour has elapsed.See DeserializeResult
            for expiration handling.

            server updater.
