<h2>Current Status</h2>

**The mod is under heavy development. There is no running version available at the moment.**

<h2>Installing</h2>

**Instruction will follow soon**

<h2>How it works</h2>

The multiplayer mod is based on the Peer To Peer system currently, with dedicated servers coming soon.

First, the client connects to the server and sends their "GameWorld", which is their company, their stocks, etc.
Secondly, the client will recieve a collection of GameWorlds from the other clients and merges them with theirs, showing other players companies and their stocks etc.
Lastly, any changes will be sent to the server to be sent to the other clients and vice versa.
